# Eye-Movement-Classification


This project reimplements the work of [Crabb et al. (2014)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00312/full), a feasibility study of whether freely recorded eye movements can be used to
separate patients with glaucoma from healthy peers. They reported that the average sensitivity for
correctly identifying a glaucoma patient at a fixed specificity of 90% was 79% (95% CI:
58 to 86%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.84
(95% CI: 0.82 to 0.87). The notebooks included in this repo describe the pre-processing and the machine learning based analysis of the original implementation following the description of the paper. The dataset used in the original paper is curated and is published in the journal Data in Brief [(Asfaw et al., 2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29922707/).
